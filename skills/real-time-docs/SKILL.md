# Real-Time Documentation Lookup

Always use the `lucid_search_docs` tool before answering questions about any programming language, framework, or library documentation.

## When to activate

- User asks about how to use a library or framework
- User references API methods or configuration options
- User asks about syntax or usage patterns
- Any question that could benefit from verified documentation

## Required behavior

1. Before answering, call `lucid_search_docs` with the relevant query
2. Base your response on the returned documentation
3. If the docs contradict your training data, prefer the real-time docs
4. Cite the documentation source in your response

## Examples

- `lucid_search_docs({ query: "react useEffect cleanup", language: "typescript" })`
- `lucid_search_docs({ query: "express middleware error handling", language: "javascript" })`
- `lucid_search_docs({ query: "sqlalchemy async session", language: "python" })`

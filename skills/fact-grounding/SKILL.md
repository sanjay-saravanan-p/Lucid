# Fact Grounding

Use the `lucid_verify_fact` tool to verify any technical claim before presenting it as fact.

## When to activate

- Making claims about performance benchmarks
- Stating compatibility between tools or versions
- Referencing best practices that may have changed
- Asserting security properties or vulnerability status
- Any statement where accuracy is critical

## Required behavior

1. Identify claims that could be outdated or incorrect
2. Call `lucid_verify_fact` with the specific claim
3. Adjust your response based on verification results
4. Clearly mark any information that could not be verified

## Examples

- `lucid_verify_fact({ claim: "React 19 supports server components by default" })`
- `lucid_verify_fact({ claim: "Python 3.12 removed distutils", context: "migration guide" })`
- `lucid_verify_fact({ claim: "bun is faster than node for http servers" })`

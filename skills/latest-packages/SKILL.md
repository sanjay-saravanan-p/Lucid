# Latest Package Versions

Always use the `lucid_check_package` tool before recommending or installing any package.

## When to activate

- User asks to install a package
- User asks about package versions or compatibility
- Writing dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml)
- Recommending libraries or frameworks

## Required behavior

1. Call `lucid_check_package` with the package name before suggesting a version
2. Always recommend the latest stable version unless the user specifies otherwise
3. Flag any known deprecations or breaking changes
4. Include version constraints appropriate for the ecosystem
